# Python TDD

## Warning

If you are having problems executing the .py files, something like *ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modules'*, try to run the **init.sh** file, lie this:

``` bash
sh init.sh
```

On your terminal (in the same folder of the **init.sh** file).

## The Three laws of TDD

by***Robert C. Martin*** *(Uncle BOB)*.\
TDD or Test Driven Design principles, based on a cycle of :
fail test -> fix code -> pass test -> fail new test ...

> **1.** You may not write production code unless you've first
> written a **failing unit test**.

---

> **2.** You may not write not write more of a unit test than is **sufficient to fail**.

---

> **3.** You may not write more production code than is **sufficient to** make the **failing unit test pass**.
